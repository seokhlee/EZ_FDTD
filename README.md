# EZ_FDTD
Straightforward FDTD using a Single Class
1D FDTD with Perfect Matched Boundary condition. Ey-Hx mode.
Two monitors for reflected and transmitted E field, updating Fourier transformation to get transmittance T and reflectance R.
Two dashed vertical lines interface different materials with different refractive indices. 
The example sets refractive indices of 1, 2.5, 1 (air) from left, middle, and right regions, respectively. 

Source is Gaussian pulse with Maximum frequency 4 GHz.

FDTD Simulation extended to 2-Dimensional
Here I used Dirichlet Boundary condition which mimics the perfect eletric conductors surrounding the simulation area, resulting in infinte bouncing of pulsed input.
Perfectly Matched Layer is coming soon.
